# Project Zion

This is the frontend client facing app for Project Neo.
We call it Zion as the whole project name is inspired by the Matrix movie.

This project is built on Svelte/SvelteKit, it's also a way for me to learn this new JS framework. It reflects the approach of me challenging my mentees on their programming journey.
